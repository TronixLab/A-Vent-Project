# Overview
Ateneo ventilator (A-vent) project is a low-cost and intelligent mechanical ventilator was developed under [Ateneo Innovation Center](https://www.ateneoinnovation.org/) (AIC) at [Ateneo de Manila University](https://www.ateneo.edu/) started during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic. The project development consist of 3 phases, the following are:
* **Phase 1** Design and development of intelligent A-vent unit
* **Phase 2** Modular alarm: real-time detection of PVA (patient-ventilator asynchrony) and machine problems
* **Phase 3** Wireless real-time monitoring: applied IoT (Internet of Things), digital twin of A-vent

## Phase 1
COVID-19 pandemic is a respiratory diseas resulted in high demand for mechanical ventilator. During the peak of pandemic, the healthcare provider around the world overwhelmed the healthcare system and lacks with mechanical ventilator unit for critically ill COVID-19 patients. The alternative solution for the ventilator demand is to use an open-source based ventilator machine was first introduced by [MIT emergency ventilator](https://emergency-vent.mit.edu/). The pandemic opens a new opportunity for institutions, and organizations worldwide to developed a low-cost ventilator machine, and the AIC was one of the respondent to that situation.

A-vent was designed and development through the leadership of Engr. [Paul M. Cabacungan](https://2012.ateneo.edu/ls/sose/ateneo-innovation-center/faculty/paul-m-cabacungan) - AIC Operation Manager together with Mr. Reymond Cao and research assistant. The initial developement was made of easily available food-grade and low-cost materials, and enough to demonstrated a minimum viable prototype. Along with the 1st development phase, we published a paper titled [Design and Development of A-vent: A Low-Cost Ventilator with Cost-Effective Mobile Cloud Caching and Embedded Machine Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9550920). This paper demonstrate the A-vent minimum viable prototype and integration of AIC technologies such Mobile/Near Cloud Computing, and Machine Learning that predicts the type of PVA as proof of concept.

## Phase 2
The A-vent unit was modified and made it smaller for transportation ease of the unit and designed with touch screen HMI (human machine interface). This development phase emphasized the application of [embedded machine learning (TinyML)](https://www.tinyml.org/) to detect the PVA and machine problems to generate a real-time alarms for intelligent monitoring of machine-and-patient interaction.

The design and development of A-vent was inspired by





The A-vent unit can delivered a pressurized air with constant rate controlled by microprocessor unit

This repository emphasize the intelligent alarm device for detecting patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA) and wireless sensor for remote monitoring of machine and patient interaction.
